# GalaEngine

Currently in development.

It uses SDL2 for access to graphics, images, fonts, input. \
Written in C++.
It uses DearIMGUI for its GUI.

This project was originally a [course](pikuma.com/courses/cpp-2d-game-engine-development) that i finished. \
I decided to further develop the engine by myself.

Engine uses ECS for its design and a little bit of data oriented design.

Footage for a very simple demo built-in to the engine.
